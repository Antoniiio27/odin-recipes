    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 whole chicken, cut into serving pieces </li>
        <li>4 ounces chicken liver</li>
        <li>3 hotdogs sliced diagonally</li>
        <li>2 potatoes, quartered</li>
        <li>2 carrots, diced</li>
        <li>2 bell peppers, sliced</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion, chopped</li>
        <li>5 dried bay leaves</li>
        <li>¾ cups green peas</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>8 ounces tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 piece Maggi Magic Chicken Cube</li>
        <li>½ cup cheddar cheese, grated</li>
        <li>Fish sauce and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>½ cooking oil</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Heat the cooking oil in a wok over medium heat until shimmering. Pan-fry the potatoes and carrots until they brown slightly, about 3 to 4 minutes, then set aside.</li>
        <li>Next, reduce the oil to 3 tablespoons and pan-fry the chicken livers for 30 seconds on each side. This quick sear keeps them tender and flavorful. Remove and set aside.</li>
        <li>Sauté the onion and garlic in the remaining oil until the onion becomes translucent. Add the chicken pieces and sauté until they turn light golden-brown to lock in juices.</li>
        <li>Pour in the soy sauce and cook for 30 seconds. Then add the sliced hotdogs and cook for 1 minute to blend their savory flavor.</li>
        <li>Add the tomato sauce and 1 cup of water, stirring well. Bring to a boil to develop a rich sauce for your Special Chicken Afritada.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken liver and dried bay leaves, then simmer for 30 minutes to meld the flavors.</li>
        <li>Stir in the green peas and bell peppers, cooking for 2 minutes. Add the fried potatoes and carrots, and mix well.</li>
        <li>Season with the Maggi Magic Chicken Cube, stirring for 1 minute. Adjust with fish sauce and ground black pepper to taste, then top with grated cheese.</li>
        <li>Transfer the Special Chicken Afritada to a serving plate, spooning some sauce over the top. Serve hot and enjoy with family or guests!
